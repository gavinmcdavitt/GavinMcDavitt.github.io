                        For my senior Capstone project, I wanted to solve a problem that currently exists with the Florida State Park System. I also wanted to
                        learn a new technology that I had never used. Those were the goals that I made for myself. This group project allowed me to 
                        learn basic React components. I used Firebase as my backend, utilizing the real-time database. It allowed me to create endpoints to interact 
                        with data about whether or not a state park was open and if you wanted to create a reservation you could. For the UI, leveraging Leaflet allowed
                        for us to create a beautiful map of different icons of Florida state parks. Utilizing a simple 3-color system (Red, Yellow, Green) created a 
                        simple yet effective way to show the user if a park was open or not.

                        I was searching through github, and found a very interesting <a href = "https://github.com/fleschutz/PowerShell"> repo </a> from <a href = "https://fleschutz.de/">Markus Fleschutz.</a> I really enjoyed,
                        this repo. I had came home from work, and having to install the salesforce CLI to create LWCS, I found the process to be a hassle. I created this PowerShell
                        code to make it easier for my fellow Trail Blazers. Clone the repo and follow the README file.

                        This is personally one of my favorite ways to solve a problem. It's super simple using Beautiful Soup 4, and you get to hunt
                        down the internet for a webpage with the right styling to make your job easier. You quickly learn that you have will also need selenium
                        to work correctly. Once you can use Beautiful Soup 4, I personally have used this in two of my favorite projects. The first was to scrape 
                        <a href="https://github.com/gavinmcdavitt/Stock_price_Scraping" target="_new"> stock data. </a> The second was to have setup 
                        code to get information about NFL games for my <a href="https://github.com/gavinmcdavitt/McDavitt-Walk-of-Shame" target="_new">family football league.</a>

                        I am currently training Einstein bots in salesforce. We as a team at CET ITS started with the creation of a Menu Bot, and have worked our ways
                        to make it an <i>enhanced</i> bot. We then seeded the bot with closed case data and Knowledge articles so that it may be used to help students out.
                        The goal is to make the bot from a menu click and have limited controls to being able to have full conversations.
